## Final group project

### General principles

Identify a biological question of interest and a relevant dataset. Develop and apply a statistical approach that allows you to use the dataset to answer the question.

We assume the biological question and data fall in the general area of high-throughput, large-scale biological investigations *targetted by the course*. Beyond that it is wide open: methylation, SNPs, miRNAs, CNVs, RNA-Seq, CHiP-Seq, gene networks, ... it's fair game. Avoid a dataset that doesn't have any/much quantitative data, i.e. contains only sequence or discrete data.

Note that definitive answers are not necessarily expected. Rather, aim to provide a critical appraisal of the data, the analytical approach, and the results. You will have to handle the competing pressures to "get it right" and "get it done". Shortcomings of the data, misfits between the data or the biological question and the statistical model, etc. are inevitable. Your goal is to identify such issues and discuss them critically, without becoming paralyzed. Demonstrate understanding of the statistical concepts and methods that are the foundation of your analytical approach.

We assume the analytical and computing task will have a substantial statistical component, probably enacted via R. So beware of a major analytical or computational undertaking that is, nonetheless, not statistical (example: constructing a database). Creating useful data visualizations can be absolutely vital and is arguably statistical, but your analysis should go beyond merely creating pretty pictures (but please do include some!). Key concepts, at least some of which should come up in your analysis:

 * the (hypothesized, probably artificial) data-generating model

 * background variation, variance, signal to noise ratio, estimates and their associated standard error

 * relationship between biological factors and experimental factors, apparent relative importance in terms of "explaining" observed data

 * attention to large-scale inference, e.g. control of family-wise error rate or false discovery rate

### Group makeup

Groups should have 4 to 6 members. We strongly encourage that groups be diverse in terms of backgrounds. In practice, this probably means the students should registered in a mix of programs/departments. All groups and group projects must be approved by the instructors.

### Initial deliverables

**Due Monday February 2 (but submit earlier if you are ready)**

 * List of group members. In addition to names, include relevant info on grad program, lab, interests/expertise. 

 * Initial project proposal describing basic idea of project. Think: a paragraph.

Each group will submit their work by responding to the Issue called "Group project: initial information" in the Discussion repository. Please, post only one proposal per group.

This information will be used to create a private repository for each group to host all work related to the project.

**Due Friday March 6**

Create a README file in the repository assigned to your group, including:

 * all information about the group 
 
 * the final proposal that provides information on the goals and division of labour. Think: a page or less.

More information will be posted about Final deliverables!
