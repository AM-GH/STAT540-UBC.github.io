### Prerequisites.

Officially none BUT here in reality ...

**Statistics**: you should have already taken university level introductory statistics course.

**Biology**: no requirements, but you are expected to learn things like the difference between a DNA and RNA and a gene and a genome.

**R**: no experience required but be prepared to do a lot of self-guided learning. Go ahead and start now by installing R and the HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "integrated development environment" (IDE) RStudio! Students are expected to run R on their own computer or a computer they have plenty of access to and control over. The best set-up, if possible, is to bring your own laptop to the computing seminars.

### Evaluation

**Homework**: two assignments worth 20 points each. Homework #1 due Thurs Feb 26. Homework #2 due Fri March 27. Instructions for how to submit your work will be posted when homework is assigned (see calendar below).

**Peer review**: you will be reviewing, commenting on, and marking other studentsâ€™ assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be marked on your peer reviews (5 points for each HW, i.e., 10% of overall course mark). Additional guidelines will be given when homework is assigned (see calendar below)

**Group project**: groups formed and projects conceived during January/February (see calendar below). Primary deliverable is a poster, presented in last class meeting (Wed April 8). Each student also produces a short report. 40 points. More information will be posted shortly.

**Participation**: 10 points for "other", including participation in class, seminars, and discussion forum, engagement with small computing exercises.
