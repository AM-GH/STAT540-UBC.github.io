Homework 1 Coaching
========================================================

### Installment 1

[Homework #1](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/blob/master/homework/hw01/hw01_quality-exploration-DE.md) assignment

Optional reading for those who could use some coaching on homework 1. I will try to post a prompt like this every couple of days 'til we're done.

Immediate goals:

1) Private repositories: We assume that by now you all have the private repositories given to you in good shape, i.e., it contains an informative README.md file and all your work lives in this repository (zz_your-name_STAT540_2015)

2) R-Git: We assume that by now you have decided whether you're going to use RStudio as your Git client (works fine) or SourceTree (or whatever), and that you know how to communicate with your repository. 

If you have problems with the previous points, I suggest you to read again the early seminars on how to communicate with your GitHub repository ([seminar 01a](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html), [seminar 01b](sm01b_gitIntro-basic-data-exploration.html), and [seminar 03a](sm03a_repoOrganization.html)), and R Markdown ([seminar 02a](sm02a_rMarkdown.html))

3) Directory: Make a top-level directory for each assignment, e.g. hw01 and hw02. Get at least a README.md file in your hw01 directory! Make a small change locally, commit, push. Establish your basic infrastructure is working. 

4) Solution file: Copy `hw01_quality-exploration-DE.md` from the course repository (https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io) to your repository (zz_your-name_STAT540_2015) and into your hw01 folder. Rename the homework file to `hw01_your-name.rmd` (use rmd since you're going to start adding R chunks as your answers).

5) Add a single R chunk that imports the data and experimental design and does, at the very least, str() on the resulting objects.

6) Knit this R markdown document to HTML. Commit!

**NOTE 1: Commit often, wait to push**: We assume you will be making periodic commits to your repository. Push closer to the submission date. Once you push, all students can see your work. 

**NOTE 2: Privacy**: your repository is visible to all students (read access only). If you learn something cool from another student's work, acknowledge it and give them some credit. You have definitely crossed the line if there's any copying and pasting of code or wording.

7) Congratulate yourself for getting started.
