### Software Carpentry Workshop and R study group 

As you all know, this class involves heavy usage of R, Git, and Unix Shell, and some people in the class are new to those tools. Many people have also expressed interest in becoming better at scientific computing. So some of you might be interested in these opportunities: 

**1. Software carpentry workshop** 

There's a software carpentry workshop coming up, from Jan 29-30, 9am - 4:30pm. The focus will be on R, Unix Shell, and version control with Git. Check out the [more details here](http://lmguzman.github.io/2016-01-29-UBC/). The workshop is open to everyone with any skill levels or disciplines!

**2. R study Group** 

This is the group that is organizing the software carpentry workshop. If you can't make it to the workshop, you can also join them to keep practicing R, Python and other coding and open science tools at their [weekly meet-ups](http://minisciencegirl.github.io/studyGroup/). 

### Updated Deadlines

Hello all, deadlines for homework, paper critiques, and the project have been updated and posted in the [syllabus](syllabus.html).
