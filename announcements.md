**April 1**: Teaching evaluations opened on Saturday, March 28 and will close on Monday, April 13th at 11:59 pm. As always, we would love to hear your feedback about the course and instructors! You can do so by completing the surveys on https://eval.ctlt.ubc.ca/science. 

**March 31**: Group project final deliverable guidelines can be found at the end of Assignments (scroll down). I've posted a rubric [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/blob/master/posterRubric2012.pdf) that you can use to review your poster before printing.

**March 23**: A coaching document for HW2 is available [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/blob/master/homework/hw02/hw02_coaching.md). 

**Soft deadline** for HW2: since this assignment came out later than planned, some students requested a potential extension of its deadline. Since you need time to work on your project, I will not change the actual deadline of HW2. However, the late-submission penalty will start running on April 4th at 12am. I strongly recommend you to finish by March 30th to have time to work on other tasks.

**March 13**: HW2 is out!! Available [here](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/blob/master/homework/hw02/hw02_array-rna-seq-dea.md).

Two main goals for this homework:
i) compare array vs RNA-Seq DEA
ii) study the effect of sequencing depth in DEA

The HW is not difficult but it is long so start working on it asap! do not underestimate the time it may take you to finish it! Due date: March 30th, 11:59pm
